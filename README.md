# INSTRUCTIONS

In this exercise you will have to create a web application that gives random compliments.
The root route has to show a random compliment that should come from the database.

In order to do so, you should:

- Create the needed models, controllers and views.
- Populate the seeds with some compliments to start with.
- Using the existing `User`` model (devise is installed) a registered user must be able to edit existing compliments or add new ones.


The base application has already Bootstrap installed and Devise with a User model.
